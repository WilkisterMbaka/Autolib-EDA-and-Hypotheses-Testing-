# Autolib-EDA-and-Hypotheses-Testing-

## **Description**
Autolib' was an electric car sharing service which was inaugurated in Paris, France, in December 2011. It closed on 31 July 2018. Our dataset provides us with data from the autolib car service such as car usage information and aggregates of the different types of cars in the Autolib Company. It also provides information on charging slots per postal code. The data was from a period of six month, from the month of January, 2018 to June, 2018.

**Research Question**

We will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Hypotheses testing. We will be working as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

Stating my hypotheses:

H0 : The is number cars taken on saturday is equal to the number of cars taken on sunday

H1 : The is number cars taken on saturday is not equal to the number of cars taken on sunday
